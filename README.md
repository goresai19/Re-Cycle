# Re-Cycle

EcoCycle is a sustainable initiative aimed at streamlining the collection and recycling of electronic waste. This open-source project provides a user-friendly platform for individuals to contribute to the reduction of e-waste by scheduling convenient pickups of their old electronic devices. A designated delivery team ensures the safe transport of collected items to the nearest recycling center.
